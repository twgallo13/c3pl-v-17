# C3PL V17.0.1 - Product Requirements Document

## Version History
- **V17.0.0**: Initial release with QA login, role switcher, console output toggle, basic debugger
- **V17.0.1**: Enhanced with Network Inspector, Schema Validator, and Error Replayer

## Core Purpose & Success

**Mission Statement**: C3PL is a comprehensive Quality Assurance and debugging tool that enables developers and QA teams to inspect, validate, and replay system interactions with full context and traceability.

**Success Indicators**: 
- Zero silent failures - all exceptions logged with full context
- Complete audit trail of all system interactions
- Successful schema validation across all modules
- Reliable error replay for debugging complex issues

**Experience Qualities**: Professional, Reliable, Comprehensive

## Project Classification & Approach

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application with advanced debugging functionality, schema validation, and error handling
**Primary User Activity**: Acting and Analyzing - users actively debug, test, and validate system behavior

## Essential Features

### Core V17.0.0 Features (Maintained)
1. **Version Display**: Prominent V17.0.1 version tag in main UI and debugger panel
2. **One-Click QA Login**: Instant authentication with predefined QA account  
3. **Role Switcher**: Dynamic switching between Vendor, Account Manager, Customer Service, Operations, and Admin roles
4. **Console Output Toggle**: Enable/disable structured logging with persona context

### New V17.0.1 Features

#### 1. Network Request Inspector
- **Functionality**: Complete visibility into API calls, payloads, response times, and error codes
- **Purpose**: Debug network issues, monitor API performance, track request/response patterns
- **Success Criteria**: All network requests captured with full metadata, searchable history, detailed inspection capabilities

#### 2. Schema Validator
- **Functionality**: Live validation of Firestore/API payloads against predefined contracts
- **Purpose**: Ensure data integrity, catch schema mismatches early, prevent data corruption
- **Success Criteria**: Real-time validation with clear error reporting, support for multiple schema contracts, warnings for unexpected fields

#### 3. Error Replayer
- **Functionality**: Capture and replay failed actions with complete log history attached
- **Purpose**: Reproduce bugs reliably, understand failure context, accelerate debugging workflows
- **Success Criteria**: Accurate error capture, reliable replay mechanism, complete context preservation

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
**Emotional Response**: Professional confidence, systematic control, debugging clarity
**Design Personality**: Technical precision with enterprise-grade polish
**Visual Metaphors**: Dashboard, control panel, diagnostic interface
**Simplicity Spectrum**: Rich interface prioritizing functionality and information density

### Color Strategy
**Color Scheme Type**: Complementary with accent highlights
**Primary Color**: Deep blue (oklch(0.35 0.15 250)) for primary actions and focus states
**Secondary Colors**: Muted blue-gray for supporting elements
**Accent Color**: Warm orange (oklch(0.62 0.25 40)) for warnings and important highlights
**Status Colors**: 
- Green (success, valid states)
- Red (errors, failures)
- Yellow (warnings, pending states)
- Gray (neutral, disabled states)

### Typography System
**Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI text, JetBrains Mono for code/data display
**Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers (600-700 weight), body (400 weight), and code (mono)
**Font Personality**: Clean, technical, highly legible
**Readability Focus**: Optimized for extended debugging sessions

### UI Components & Layout
**Component Usage**: 
- Cards for feature grouping and content organization
- Tabs for feature switching in debugger panel
- Tables and scrollable areas for data inspection
- Badges for status indicators and version tags
- Buttons with clear visual hierarchy (primary, secondary, outline, destructive)

**Component States**: 
- Loading states for async operations
- Error states with clear messaging
- Success confirmations for completed actions
- Disabled states for unavailable features

### Animations
**Purposeful Motion**: Subtle transitions for state changes, smooth tab switching, gentle loading indicators
**Performance Focus**: All animations under 300ms, no blocking transitions

## Technical Implementation

### TypeScript Validation
- Full type safety with proper interfaces for all data structures
- No silent type conversions or unhandled edge cases
- Comprehensive error boundaries with typed error handling

### State Management
- Persistent state using useKV hooks for cross-session data retention
- Reactive state updates for real-time debugging information
- Proper cleanup and memory management for debugging data

### Logging & Monitoring
- Structured logging with actor, module, and timestamp context
- Schema validation warnings logged with full context
- All exceptions captured with stack traces and replay data

### Build & Compliance
- Zero TypeScript errors in production build
- All changes tracked and tied to version V17.0.1
- Complete audit trail for GitHub migration readiness

## Transition Readiness Checklist
