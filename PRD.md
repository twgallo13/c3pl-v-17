# C3PL V17.0.0 Product Requirements Document

C3PL is a debugging and role management tool for quality assurance testing with instant login capabilities and console output control.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Professional** - Clean, enterprise-grade interface suitable for QA and development teams
2. **Efficient** - One-click actions and instant role switching to maximize testing productivity  
3. **Precise** - Clear visual hierarchy and structured logging for accurate debugging workflows

**Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with basic state)
- Provides role switching, login simulation, and console management with persistent state across sessions

## Essential Features

### Version Display
- **Functionality**: Display V17.0.0 prominently in main UI and debugger panel
- **Purpose**: Version tracking and audit compliance for development lifecycle
- **Trigger**: Application load
- **Progression**: App loads → version displays in header and debugger panel
- **Success criteria**: V17.0.0 visible in both locations with consistent styling

### One-Click QA Login  
- **Functionality**: Instant authentication with predefined QA account credentials
- **Purpose**: Streamline testing workflows by eliminating manual login steps
- **Trigger**: Click QA Login button
- **Progression**: Click button → instant login simulation → success confirmation
- **Success criteria**: Login state changes immediately with visual feedback

### Role Switcher
- **Functionality**: Toggle between Vendor, Account Manager, Customer Service, Operations, Admin roles
- **Purpose**: Test different user permission levels and role-based functionality
- **Trigger**: Select role from dropdown or toggle interface
- **Progression**: Select role → role state updates → UI reflects new permissions/context
- **Success criteria**: Role persists between sessions and affects UI appropriately

### Console Output Toggle
- **Functionality**: Enable/disable structured logging output
- **Purpose**: Control debugging verbosity and log management during testing
- **Trigger**: Toggle console output switch
- **Progression**: Toggle switch → logging state changes → console reflects new setting
- **Success criteria**: Logs appear/disappear based on toggle state with proper formatting

## Edge Case Handling
- **Role Conflicts**: Default to Admin role if invalid role state detected
- **Login Failures**: Display error state but maintain debugger functionality
- **Console Overflow**: Implement log rotation to prevent memory issues
- **Version Mismatch**: Always display current V17.0.0 regardless of cached state

## Design Direction
The design should feel professional and systematic like enterprise development tools, with clean lines and structured layouts that prioritize function over form while maintaining visual clarity.

## Color Selection
Complementary (opposite colors) - Using blue/orange pairing to create clear visual distinction between active/inactive states and primary/secondary actions.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue (#1e40af) - Communicates trust and technical professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Light Blue (#3b82f6) for secondary actions, Gray (#6b7280) for neutral elements
- **Accent Color**: Orange (#ea580c) - Attention-grabbing highlight for active states and critical actions
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: 
  - Background (White #ffffff): Dark Gray text (#374151) - Ratio 8.9:1 ✓
  - Card (Light Gray #f9fafb): Dark Gray text (#374151) - Ratio 8.2:1 ✓  
  - Primary (Deep Blue #1e40af): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 8.6:1 ✓
  - Accent (Orange #ea580c): White text (#ffffff) - Ratio 4.9:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Typography should convey technical precision and clarity using monospace elements for code/version numbers and clean sans-serif for interface text.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**: 
  - H1 (Version Display): JetBrains Mono Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Panel Headers): Inter Semibold/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Interface Text): Inter Regular/14px/relaxed line height
  - Code (Logs): JetBrains Mono Regular/12px/monospace spacing

## Animations
Subtle functionality with minimal motion - animations should communicate state changes clearly without distracting from debugging workflows.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Quick transitions communicate immediate system response and build confidence in tool reliability
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Role switches and login actions get priority animation focus as primary user interactions

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Card for debugger panel, Button for actions, Select for role switching, Switch for console toggle, Badge for version display
- **Customizations**: Custom console output component with scrollable log area and structured formatting
- **States**: All interactive elements have clear hover, active, and disabled states with subtle shadows and color shifts
- **Icon Selection**: Settings gear for debugger panel, User icon for roles, Terminal for console, Check for login success
- **Spacing**: Consistent 4-unit (16px) padding for panels, 2-unit (8px) for compact elements
- **Mobile**: Debugger panel converts to drawer on mobile, version display remains fixed in header, touch-optimized button sizes
