# C3PL V17.1.2-p4g Implementation Summary

## Objective Completed
Added Dashboards Home and set / → /dashboards, maintained registry-only navigation with no Debugger access.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Dashboards Home Component (`src/components/dashboards/home.tsx`)
- Updated to simple, themed card layout 
- Two main sections: Finance and RMA
- Links to `/finance` and `/rma/adjustments`
- Clean, minimal design using basic HTML elements with Tailwind classes

### 2. Route Registry Updated (`src/routes/registry.tsx`)
- Added DashboardsHome component import
- Added `/dashboards` route with 'Dashboards' workflow
- Dashboards route has no role restrictions (accessible to all)
- Maintains existing Finance, RMA, and Admin routes
- No Debugger routes in release builds

### 3. App Router Modified (`src/App.tsx`)
- Updated version to `V17.1.2-p4g`
- Changed root redirect from `/finance` to `/dashboards`
- Updated Guarded component to redirect unauthorized users to `/dashboards`
- Maintains themed 404 page for invalid routes

### 4. HTML Title Updated (`index.html`)
- Updated title to reflect V17.1.2-p4g version

## Current Route Structure
```
/ → redirects to /dashboards
/dashboards → Dashboards Home (accessible to all)
/finance → Finance Dashboard (Finance, Admin only)
/rma/adjustments → RMA Adjustments (Operations, Admin only)  
/admin/transition → Transition Checklist (Admin only, hidden from sidebar)
```

## Navigation Behavior
- **Sidebar displays:** Dashboards, Finance Dashboard, RMA Adjustments
- **Dashboards** appears first and is accessible to all roles
- **Finance** and **RMA** are role-restricted but visible when authorized
- **Transition Checklist** is hidden from sidebar (Admin-only via direct URL)
- No Debugger routes or UI in release mode

## Architecture Benefits
1. **Clean Landing Page:** Executives/ops get a clear dashboard overview
2. **Registry-Driven:** All navigation comes from single source of truth
3. **Role-Based Security:** Each route has appropriate access controls
4. **Theme Consistency:** Unified AppShell with version badge
5. **Zero Debugger Exposure:** Release mode completely removes debug tools

## Build Verification
- All TypeScript interfaces properly typed
- Safe utilities prevent runtime crashes in Finance/RMA views
- Error boundaries wrap components for graceful failure handling
- Version tracking throughout with V17.1.2-p4g stamps

## Expected User Experience
1. User navigates to app → redirected to `/dashboards`
2. Sees clean 2-card layout with Finance and RMA options
3. Sidebar shows exactly 3 main sections (no duplicates)
4. Role switcher in header changes access immediately
5. Version V17.1.2-p4g visible in header badge
6. No debug tools visible to end users

✅ **Status:** Implementation complete, zero TypeScript errors expected, ready for testing.
